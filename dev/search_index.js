This helps with the implementation of matrix-free methods for iterative solvers.\n\nThe package has been designed with high-performance in mind, so should outperform the non-lazy analogues from Base for many operations like copyto! and broadcasting. Some operations will be inherently slower due to extra computation, like getindex. Please file an issue for any examples that are significantly slower than their the analogue in Base.\n\nConcatenation\n\nVcat is the lazy analogue of vcat. For lazy vectors like ranges, it creating such a vector is allocation-free. copyto! allows for allocation-free population of a vector.\n\njulia> using LazyArrays, BenchmarkTools\n\njulia> A = Vcat(1:5,2:3) # allocation-free\n7-element Vcat{Int64,1,Tuple{UnitRange{Int64},UnitRange{Int64}}}:\n 1\n 2\n 3\n 4\n 5\n 2\n 3\n\njulia> Vector(A) == vcat(1:5, 2:3)\ntrue\n\njulia> b = Array{Int}(undef, length(A)); @btime copyto!(b, A);\n  26.670 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)\n\njulia> @btime vcat(1:5, 2:3); # takes twice as long due to memory creation\n  43.336 ns (1 allocation: 144 bytes)\n\nSimilarly, Hcat is the lazy analogue of hcat.\n\njulia> A = Hcat(1:3, randn(3,10))\n3×11 Hcat{Float64,Tuple{UnitRange{Int64},Array{Float64,2}}}:\n 1.0   0.350927   0.339103  -1.03526   …   0.786593    0.0416694\n 2.0  -1.10206    1.52817    0.223099      0.851804    0.430933\n 3.0  -1.26467   -0.743712  -0.828781     -0.0637502  -0.066743\n\njulia> Matrix(A) == hcat(A.arrays...)\ntrue\n\njulia> b = Array{Int}(undef, length(A)); @btime copyto!(b, A);\n  26.670 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)\n\njulia> B = Array{Float64}(undef, size(A)...); @btime copyto!(B, A);\n  109.625 ns (1 allocation: 32 bytes)\n\njulia> @btime hcat(A.arrays...); # takes twice as long due to memory creation\n  274.620 ns (6 allocations: 560 bytes)\n\nBroadcasting\n\nBase now includes a lazy broadcast object called Broadcasting, but this is not a subtype of AbstractArray. Here we have BroadcastArray which replicates the functionality of Broadcasting while supporting the array interface.\n\njulia> A = randn(6,6);\n\njulia> B = BroadcastArray(exp, A);\n\njulia> Matrix(B) == exp.(A)\ntrue\n\njulia> B = BroadcastArray(+, A, 2);\n\njulia> B == A .+ 2\ntrue\n\nSuch arrays can also be created using the macro @~ which acts on ordinary  broadcasting expressions combined with LazyArray:\n\njulia> C = rand(1000)';\n\njulia> D = LazyArray(@~ exp.(C))\n\njulia> E = LazyArray(@~ @. 2 + log(C))\n\njulia> @btime sum(LazyArray(@~ C .* C'); dims=1) # without `@~`, 1.438 ms (5 allocations: 7.64 MiB)\n  74.425 μs (7 allocations: 8.08 KiB)\n\nMultiplication\n\nFollowing Base's lazy broadcasting, we introduce lazy multiplication. The type Mul support multiplication of any two objects, not necessarily arrays. (In the future there will be a MulArray a la BroadcastArray.)\n\nMul is designed to work along with broadcasting, and to lower to BLAS calls whenever possible:\n\njulia> A = randn(5,5); b = randn(5); c = randn(5); d = similar(c);\n\njulia> d .= 2.0 .* Mul(A,b) .+ 3.0 .* c # Calls gemv!\n5-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.5366335879717514\n -5.305097174484744  \n -9.818431932350942  \n  2.421562605495651  \n  0.26792916096572983\n\njulia> 2*(A*b) + 3c\n5-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.5366335879717514\n -5.305097174484744  \n -9.818431932350942  \n  2.421562605495651  \n  0.26792916096572983\n\njulia> function mymul(A, b, c, d) # need to put in function for benchmarking\n       d .= 2.0 .* Mul(A,b) .+ 3.0 .* c\n       end\nmymul (generic function with 1 method)\n\njulia> @btime mymul(A, b, c, d) # calls gemv!\n  77.444 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)\n5-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.5366335879717514\n -5.305097174484744  \n -9.818431932350942  \n  2.421562605495651  \n  0.26792916096572983\n\njulia> @btime 2*(A*b) + 3c; # does not call gemv!\n  241.659 ns (4 allocations: 512 bytes)\n\nUsing @~ macro, above expression using Mul can also be written as\n\nd .= @~ 2.0 .* (A * b) .+ 3.0 .* c\n\nInverses\n\nWe also have lazy inverses PInv(A), designed to work alongside Mul to  to lower to BLAS calls whenever possible:\n\njulia> A = randn(5,5); b = randn(5); c = similar(b);\n\njulia> c .= Mul(PInv(A), b)\n5-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.5366335879717514\n -5.305097174484744  \n -9.818431932350942  \n  2.421562605495651  \n  0.26792916096572983\n\njulia> c .= Ldiv(A, b) # shorthand for above\n5-element Array{Float64,1}:\n -2.5366335879717514\n -5.305097174484744  \n -9.818431932350942  \n  2.421562605495651  \n  0.26792916096572983\n\nKronecker products\n\nWe can represent Kronecker products of arrays without constructing the full array.\n\njulia> A = randn(2,2); B = randn(3,3);\n\njulia> K = Kron(A,B)\n6×6 Kron{Float64,2,Tuple{Array{Float64,2},Array{Float64,2}}}:\n  1.99255  -1.45132    0.864789  -0.785538   0.572163  -0.340932\n -2.7016    0.360785  -1.78671    1.06507   -0.142235   0.70439\n  1.89938  -2.69996    0.200992  -0.748806   1.06443   -0.0792386\n -1.84225   1.34184   -0.799557  -2.45355    1.7871    -1.06487\n  2.49782  -0.333571   1.65194    3.32665   -0.444258   2.20009\n -1.75611   2.4963    -0.185831  -2.33883    3.32464   -0.247494\n\njulia> C = Matrix{Float64}(undef, 6, 6); @btime copyto!(C, K);\n  61.528 ns (0 allocations: 0 bytes)\n\njulia> C == kron(A,B)\ntrue\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"module"},{"location":"#LazyArrays.LazyArray","page":"Home","title":"LazyArrays.LazyArray","text":"LazyArray(x::Applied) :: ApplyArray\nLazyArray(x::Broadcasted) :: BroadcastArray\n\nWrap a lazy object that wraps a computation producing an array to an array.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"type"},{"location":"#LazyArrays.cache-Union{Tuple{MT}, Tuple{Type{MT},AbstractArray}} where MT<:AbstractArray","page":"Home","title":"LazyArrays.cache","text":"cache(array::AbstractArray)\n\nCaches the entries of an array.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"#LazyArrays.@~-Tuple{Any}","page":"Home","title":"LazyArrays.@~","text":"@~ expr\n\nMacro for creating a Broadcasted or Applied object.
